I want to, brand my collection. So that it does not look like a generic collection.
I want to, be able to assign hierarchical structures to sub-collections. So that it is clear that my sub-collections are part of a hierarchical group.
I want to, delegate permission to certain individuals to be able to manage/edit items and metadata for records already in a collection. So that those individuals can login and edit things only where I've given permission.
I want to, be notified when any part of a digital object's bitstream changes (from its original checksum). So that I can ensure the fixity of objects in the digital library by comparing any checksum changes.
I want, university staff members to be able to submit things through a designated page for university records by using their 6+2 and without having to sign up for a DR account. This would preferably be done through a single page on the ARB website as a portal for depositing electronic university records. So that submission of university records is more consistent and easier, but university staff submitters do not have control of submissions beyond the initial upload process.
I want to, be able to review and approve for public display the university records submitted by university staff members. So that submission of university records is mediated.
I want to, delegate specific permissions to certain individuals to be able to submit items to some parts of my collection, but not others. So that those individuals can login and upload things only where I've given permission.
